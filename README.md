## TO THE HiIRING TEAM
senior men, i hail ooo!! abeg show your boy love. just overlook any slight deviations from the UI design you might find. Also, due to the constraint of time I could not use typeScript, I used pure reactjs as I was more fluent in it and I had to meet up with the deadline. 
thank you
